# GoDecentra ðŸš€

Go Decentra is a blockchain implementation written in the Go programming language. This project demonstrates the core principles of blockchain technology by creating a decentralized ledger of blocks. Each block contains:  

- Previous Hash: Links the block to the blockchain.  
- Current Hash: Ensures the integrity of the block's data.  
- Timestamp: Captures when the block was created.  
- Data: Stores information about books, including:  
  - Title  
  - Author  
  - Publish Date  
  - ISBN  

The project utilizes the following key Go packages:  
- Mux: For routing and handling HTTP requests to interact with the blockchain.  
- Other standard Go libraries to efficiently manage cryptographic hashing, timestamps, and data structures.
